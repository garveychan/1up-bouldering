##### Stopgap Solutions

Noting the limited time-frame for this assignment, we present stopgap solutions in lieu of more challenging features until they can be developed and deployed. Ideally these will be completed and tested prior to the launch of the gym.

  - We could implement a temporary portal for members to check-in on entry using their name and date of birth.
- **Member Dashboard**
  - Members could sit down with the gym owner at the reception in order to have their details updated in the database.
- **Owner Dashboard**
  - Membership status and payment history could be manually reviewed on a regular basis.
- **Integrated Billing System**
  - Membership payments could be collected on entry.
- **Email Communication**
  - Members could be contacted via their phone numbers.
