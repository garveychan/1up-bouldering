## Wireframes

#### UI / UX Considerations

In developing the wireframes and prototypes for our application's front-end, we adhered to first principles of quality web design such as establishing a **visual hierarchy**, **F-shaped pattern reading** and **intuitive navigation**. These guidelines allowed us to construct user journeys with minimal friction that align with our client's requirements.

#### Prototypes

##### [Desktop Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/GpZg1xsCkVtwKkjgpk6l2K/Wireframes?node-id=3%3A206&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A206&hide-ui=1)

##### [Mobile Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/wSmxFUieO5vC3xvPgNf2aM/Wireframes-Mobile?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=3%3A206&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=3%3A206&hide-ui=1)

![Desktop Overview](./docs/wireframes/wireframes_desktop_overview.png)
![Mobile Overview](./docs/wireframes/wireframes_mobile_overview.png)

##### Laws of UX - Aesthetic-Usability Effect
  - Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design thatâ€™s more usable.
  - In order to achieve this effect, we leverage TailwindCSS to build modern and performant styled components with thoughtful spacing, typography, shadows, and colour choices. 

#### Check-In Portal

![Check-In Portal](./docs/wireframes/checkin_portal.png)

##### Laws of UX - Fitts' Law
  - The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
  - The objective of the check-in portal is to provide an efficient way for members to signal their presence on entry to the gym.
  - As we want to avoid multiple gym entrants lining up on the terminals and causing delays, the key metric here is check-in time.
  - Fitts' Law has been applied in implementing the check-in functionality at the forefront of the portal, minimising the time required for members to identify themselves.

#### Login / Password Recovery

![Login / Password Recovery](./docs/wireframes/login_recovery.png)

##### Laws of UX - Jakob's Law
  - Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar.
  - In this case, we implement universally recognised login and password recovery forms.

#### Member Onboarding

![Member Onboarding 1](./docs/wireframes/onboarding_1.png)
![Member Onboarding 2](./docs/wireframes/onboarding_2.png)
![Member Onboarding 3](./docs/wireframes/onboarding_3.png)

##### Functions
  - Instant input validation error message feedback.
  - Scrollable acknowledgements and waivers.

##### Laws of UX - Goal Gradient Effect
  - The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
  - By displaying indicators at the top of each onboarding page, we provide a clear indication of progress in order to motivate users to complete the task.

#### Member Dashboard

##### Functions
  - Instant input validation error message feedback.

![Member Dashboard](./docs/wireframes/member_dashboard.png)

#### Admin Dashboard

##### Functions
  - Scrollable member list with pagination.
  - Search/filter members by keyword or attribute.

## Client Engagement

### Meetings

#### Offline discussions

- Client has emphasised the importance of having robust data analytics capability within the system - targeting membership demographics such as age, gender, locale and trends such as frequency of use, payment cycles, etc.
- Client would prefer membership tag system to be integrated into the application.

#### 11am Saturday 10/07/21

## Project Management

### Planning Methodology

The planning of this project adheres to the principles of Agile project management, leveraging relevant techniques and methodologies to maximise the benefits of collaboration, respond quickly to client feedback and accelerate development speed.

#### Blueprint

In applying the principles of Agile, we first break our product down into its **core components**, using these to outline our **Epics** which we segment into individual **User Stories**. The **challenges** and **difficulty levels** of each user story are identified to support an **evidence-based** approach towards **estimating** each task's **resource requirements**. These data points can then be used to outline a **roadmap** for tracking and measuring **incremental progress** within the project timeline, allowing our plan to evolve as events unfold.

#### Development Process

By identifying the **constituent** pillars of our application and prioritising them to define our **Minimum Viable Product**, we allow ourselves to prepare incremental features and put them through our **user testing pipeline** - gathering important **feedback** and **adapting** our solution for new requirements. In doing so, we must also employ best practice coding principles to keep our features and modules **loosely coupled** in support of a more **maintainable** codebase.

#### Communication

Separate communication channels have been established, each pertaining to a major requirement of the project. Categorising the discussions in this way will prove helpful for **future reference**, particularly as the complexity of the project continues to grow. A separate channel has been created to serve as an **audit trail** for client engagement.

|Category|Channel|
|:--|:--|
|Client Engagement|General, Feedback, Meetings|
|Project Management|General, Docs & Design, Version Control, Development, User Testing, Production|
|Features|Profiles, Insights, Check-Ins, Payments, Styling|

### Delegation Methodology

The delegation of tasks within this project is executed and managed through the use of a traditional [**Kanban Board**](https://trello.com/b/a1wC5ZhV/full-stack-app-t3a2-1up-bouldering) on **Trello**. The Kanban approach was chosen for its **continuous flow**, with the expectation that project requirements will change as the development of the application progresses and **regular feedback** from user and client testing is incorporated. 

#### Tasks

Individual cards on the **Kanban board** will be distilled from the **Epic** being developed within that particular cycle. Each of these cards will align with a single **User Story**, broken down into **subtasks** and attached as a checklist. Having defined all user stories with consideration for their **challenges** and **difficulty**, each card will be delegated based on the developer's **familiarity** and **experience** with the subject matter.

#### Performance

**Cycle time** will be measured as a key metric for success in the project, helping to identify **bottlenecks** which can be resolved with **code review**, **pair programming** and **knowledge sharing**. A preliminary **Work In Progress (WIP) Limit** of 3 cards within the **review** state of the Kanban board will prevent the project from moving forward in the wrong direction as unresolved issues may necessitate a redesign of the application's underlying architecture. This limit will be reviewed with each **Daily Retrospective** and adjusted to match the throughput of the team.
